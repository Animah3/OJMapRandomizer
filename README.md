# OJMapRandomizer

This project was aimed at experimenting with GUI development in Python.

My friend group plays an online board game called 100% Orange Juice and in the game there are good maps and bad maps. Essentially this project seeked to produce a random output from a list of 'Good' maps. We didn't want repeat maps to show up, unless explicity wanted (by resetting the unused map list).

The GUI development was achieved using the TKinter library. The final design was a very base-level GUI, as this is my first hands on experience with GUI development. I also imported the Python Imaging Library (PIL) in order to add a design to the GUI.

The end product was packaged as an .exe using pyinstaller to be distributed to expected users. This pre-made distribution is located within the 'OJRand' folder (full folder is requied for application to work, which means provided images must be in the same location as the .exe)
